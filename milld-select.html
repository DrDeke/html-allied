  <p>This 'tour' is divided into two sections. Mill D used to contain a power 
    plant of its own, most of which has now been torn down. There is a relatively 
    small building that still stands that seems to be related to the Mill D power 
    plant, given the electrical gear that it contains, and given its proximity 
    to the former power plant's smokestack. It is unclear whether this powerplant 
    building is or is not actually connected to the rest of the Mill D complex, 
    but even if it is, the area of the building in which the connection would 
    be made is too dangerous to enter. Therefore, we entered this building through 
    one of its outside entrances, and accessed the rest of the Mill D complex 
    through a different entrance. Given this fact, I have made separate pages 
    for Mill D and for its power-outbuilding, both of which may be accessed below.
