Actually, that's just when these particular   pictures were taken - I only have a mish-mash of photographs of this part of   the mill, taken during different seasons and different times of day and night.   One of these days, I'll go there and take a comprehensive set of photographs and revamp this portion of the tour.</font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font size="-1"><img src="photo/grounds/115-1576_IMG.jpg" width="400" height="300"> <br>  Looking all the way down the north side of the mill, it becomes apparent that Mill C is indeed very large.</font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font size="-1"><img src="photo/grounds/115-1578_IMG.jpg" width="400" height="300">|<br>  One of the more dilapidated portions of Mill C...</font></p><p align="center"><font size="-1"><br>  <img src="photo/grounds/115-1580_IMG.jpg" width="400" height="300"> <br>  Here is a cool-looking portion of Mill C. The corrugated metal room at the very top is reported by one of my friends to contain a machine known as a &quot;deculator&quot;,     although I've never had the opportunity to go up there personally. Evidently,     a deculator is used to remove air bubbles from the paper machine feed stock     before it is pumped into the machine. If I am not mistaken, I believe that the     part of the building on the right of the photo, with the large paned windows,   is the No. 6 machine room.</font></p><p align="center"><font size="-1"><br>  <br>  <img src="photo/grounds/115-1579_IMG.jpg" width="400" height="300"> <br>  Looking down the street to the west, we see the overhead passage between Mill C and the power plant. It contains a multitude of pipes, and also a human-accessible walkway. Someone has recently gone in there and written graffiti on its windows. I've looked into the passage from the powerhouse, and it looks far too unpleasant to enter according to my tastes.</font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/image3.jpg" width="400" height="285"><font size="-1"><br>  Looking back the other way...<a href="#scredit">*</a></font></p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Here we have a few shots of the extreme north / west side of Mill   C:</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/image37.jpg" width="400" height="290">   <br>  <a href="#scredit"><font size="-1">*</font></a></p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/image57.jpg" width="400" height="271"><br>  <font size="-1">Mill C viewed from in front of Mill D. <a href="#scredit">*</a></font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/image42.jpg" width="400" height="286">   <br>  <font size="-1">The west end of Mill C. <a href="#scredit">*</a></font></p><p align="center"><font size="-1"><br>  </font><font size="-1"><br>  <img src="photo/grounds/114-1498_CRW.jpg" width="400" height="300"> <br>  A somewhat tree-cluttered view of Mill C from near the envelope company.</font></p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">That's about all for Mill C.
