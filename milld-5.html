  </p>
  <p>We pause as a cellular phone call is placed at the back end of the machine 
    room.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2714.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2714.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>There's a lot of junk in this area, and some more holes with guardrails around 
    them that seem to go down into various tanks.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2715.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2715.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>It looks like another beater, or maybe it's something else - it's hard to 
    tell from the photo.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2716.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2716.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>In any case, it requires a permit if one wished to go inside it while the 
    mill was in business.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2718.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2718.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Looking inside seems to confirm its beaterness. Those openings in the floor 
    must have been for the pumping in and out of various chemicals (and the pulp 
    once the beating process was complete).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2719.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2719.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>There is a funny looking aperture in the floor, which I believe leads to 
    what is known as a stock chest. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2726.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2726.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>As do these.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2725.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2725.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Peering into one of the alleged stock chests.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2727.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2727.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>A fluorescent light fixture once illuminated... something, here.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2728.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2728.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>We seem to have reached the back wall of the mill (more or less anyway).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2731.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2731.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>There is a combined bathroom and locker room in the back of the mill.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2736.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2736.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Heading west to cross the creek, one runs into this semi-rectangular object 
    made out of a kind of tile similar to those out of which the beaters are made. 
    I wonder what this object is.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2738.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2738.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>What kind of circuit breaker handle won't de-energize the breaker?? This 
    one, evidently. (C. Demaine notes that after reading this, one should have 
    more appreciation for the breakers in the powerhouse with the transparent 
    windows so that one can visually see whether the power is indeed disconnected 
    or not.) </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2739.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2739.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Another electrical doodad, this one tagged as 'hot'. C. Demaine tells us 
    that this box contains a bunch of electrical controls, including some contactors 
    (usually found in MCCs) which are used to switch three-phase power, and that 
    this box was used to control several small three-phase devices that were tightly 
    integrated. He also notes that the device in the background is probably a 
    regular MCC.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A view out of the window while crossing the creek. A very large cross-section 
    of the building goes over the creek here, unlike the small passageway seen 
    out the window.</p>
