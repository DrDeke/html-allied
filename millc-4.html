    A view down the production line of the No. 6 paper machine.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010082.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010082.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    A closer view.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010083.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010083.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Some safety rails on the other side of the machine room.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010086.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010086.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>

    Near the wet end of the paper machine is this pit covered by ceramic tile. 
    I suppose it received the extra pulp that would drip off the paper machine 
    in the early stages of production (this type of tile, unlike many other materials, 
    was able to withstand the chemicals present in paper pulp). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010088.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010088.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    A nice view down the production line from the other end (the wet end). Notice 
    those large vents above it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010072.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010072.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    This device appears to be the loading hopper to a broke pulper or something. 
    If paper coming off the machine was of terrible quality or if the machine 
    broke and ruined some paper, the waste paper would be put down this machine 
    to be turned back into pulp to be mixed with fresh pulp for a future run.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010073.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010073.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    A blue control panel next to the broke chest thing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010076.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010076.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Those vent pipes above the paper machine are really large. Actually, this 
    probably has something to do with the inefficiency of the mill - modern paper 
    machines do not discard their waste heat, but they collect it and it is reused 
    for other purposes (heating other portions of the building or to pre-heat 
    more boiler feed water), which saves on energy costs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010068.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010068.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    In a little room off of the No. 6 machine room, one finds this ancient computer. 
    Unfortunately, someone has stolen the boards that used to be in its upper 
    rack (they were present the first time we were in the mill).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010067.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010067.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    The box on the wall there used to contain some sort of power monitoring and 
    perhaps UPS system. When we were here the first time, the power was turned 
    on in most of the building, and the machine in that box was flashing some 
    screens of information about some voltages and loads. However, as with the 
    computer boards, the machine's innards appear to have been stolen.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010091.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010091.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Back out in the No. 6 machine room, one finds this electronic control panel 
    that once controlled the paper machine. The first time we were in Mill C, 
    this device was also powered up (although the paper machine itself had already 
    been removed), and it was flashing a number of dire warnings such as, &quot;Headbox 
    Feed Pressure Too Low&quot;, &quot;Paper Machine Speed Too Low&quot;, &quot;Stock 
    Chest 1 Level Too Low&quot;, etc... </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010093.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010093.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    This less-sophisticated control panel sits next to the electronic one, and 
    has had most of its indicators and equipment removed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010095.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010095.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    This spectacle sits in the corner of the No. 6 machine room. I wonder what 
    &quot;ACM&quot; is, and what the deal with that whole situation was.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010097.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010097.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Stepping out of the No. 6 machine room, we find these devices which look like 
    Allen Bradley Motor Control Centers - they were probably used to run the motors 
    on the No. 6 and No. 7 machines, given their proximity to the paper machine 
    rooms.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010098.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010098.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    This room contains a pipe labelled &quot;City Water&quot;, and a rather small 
    pump.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010099.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010099.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a> 
    <br>
    It also contains the No. 6 Saveall. A saveall has something to do with enabling 
    the re-use of the leftover pulp mixture that drips out of the paper machine 
    but I forget exactly what. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010100.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010100.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    The end of the saveall looks rather dirty.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010101.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010101.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    The room contains some other equipment in somewhat raggedy condition.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010101.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010102.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Here we have the No. 7 machine room. It seems a bit smaller than the No. 6 
    line. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010104.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010104.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Peering down into the No. 7 machine pit.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010105.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010105.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Some pipes on the wall across from the No. 7 machine.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010107.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010107.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Beyond the No. 7 paper machine room is an exit to the mill with an interesting 
    safety reminder posted over it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010108.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010108.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Only the management offices get air conditioning in this mill.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010112.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010112.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    On the way back out of the mill, we pass by a lot of odd looking stuff...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010114.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010114.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    ...including the main steam line coming into Mill C from the powerhouse. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010001.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010001.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Exiting the mill, we once again pause to observe the power plant out the window.</p>
