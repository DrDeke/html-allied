<p align="left"><strong>Mill Info:</strong></p>
<p align="left">The Allied Paper factory currently consists of three mill buildings, 
  Mill C, Mill D, and Mill E, and a power plant (The Power House). There are also 
  several electrical switchgear cabinets on the property, a Consumers' Energy 
  substation (which has now mostly been removed by Consumers'), and the remains 
  of an overhead viaduct that once carried steam, process water, and perhaps electricity 
  between the above mentioned buildings on the north side of Alcott street and 
  the former Mill A and Mill B buildings south of Alcott. (Mills A and B were 
  torn down some years ago.)</p>
<p align="left">When I first became aware of the mill's existance, the property 
  was completely abandoned (in terms of production and security), but Mill C still 
  had electrical service to its lighting and remaining machinery, and some of 
  the control panels in the Power House were still lit (although the building's 
  electrical service did not appear to be online). However, several weeks after 
  a court hearing about the property in the summer of 2001, (the details of which 
  I do not know, although it has been suggested that it was a <em>Final Bankruptcy 
  Hearing</em>), Consumers' Energy deactivated and then removed most of the components 
  of the substation that was powering the facility, leaving it powerless. Also, 
  in December 2000, the remaining portion of Mill E (some of which had been torn 
  down in the past) collapsed under the weight of heavy snowfall. On October 18th, 
  2001, one of the front sections of Mill C (consisting mostly of laboratory and 
  office space) caught fire, evidently as a result of actions by vandals or other 
  criminals. According to sources, the fire department quickly put out the fire, 
  and in any case, the damage was confined, largely due to the firewall between 
  the labs/offices and the manufacturing areas of the Mill. None of the building 
  collapsed at the time of the fire or last winter (which was mild), but we shall 
  see what happens come this winter.</p>
<p align="left">It has been rumoured that the City is going to have the mill torn 
  down in the summer of 2003. Although nature is already working on the task, 
  it would be a shame to see it torn down prematurely, as some portions of the 
  structures are extremely stable and look like they would last for some time. 
  I suppose we shall see.</p>
