    <td align="center" valign="top"><p align="center">I obtained a brief tour of the Crown Vantage Paper Mill's 
        powerhouse [many thanks to the guys working there near the end who let 
        us in!] shortly before that plant permanently shut down, and judging from 
        the amount of electrical panels and equipment in its turbine room, I suspect 
        that in addition to the turbines, much switching and control equipment 
        has been removed from this room as well. The single remaining electrical 
        control panel (visible in the far corner of the first image, and detailed 
        images below) was connected to the power grid on our earlier visits to 
        the plant, as evidenced by the fact that some of its indicator lights 
        were lit.</p>

      <p align="center">We've gone upstairs and are looking into what used to 
        be the turbine room, when it still contained turbines.</p>

      <p align="center">You can get a good view of the tops of those cylinders
        from up here. One really has to wonder exactly what those things did.</p>

      <p align="center">Some interesting chemical tanks exist up here. I wonder
    what was (or is) in them.</p></td>

<p align="center">There's a heavy piece of equipment. Perhaps it was part of
  a turbine at one point?</p>

<p align="center">Gages and lights on a control panel in the corner of the room
  near the outdoor substation. Some of the indicator lights on this panel were
  lit during one of our earlier visits. (<a href="/photo/pwr/image53.jpg">This
  photo</a> <a href="#scaron">*</a> shows the whole panel as of June 2000.) Now
  what I want to know, is whose idea of a good time is it to come into power
  plants and smash and/or steal indicator lightbulbs from panels as seems to
  have happened to many of the bulbs on this panel between the June 2000 photo
  and the current ones. I mean, the bulbs are tiny. It's not like they're even
  gonna make a big smashing noise, geez! Although I do know some people who might
  have been interested in stealing them, some of the fixtures definately look
  smashed up to me. </p>

<p align="center">The panel contains some switches, too. C. Demaine says that
  this panel was likely used to show and possibly control the mill's power utilization
  - if power started to fail or was coming up, you'd want to know what was running
  and what wasn't, so you could arrange to shed some load and prevent further
  outage. </p>

<p align="center">There goes another big steam pipe! This one goes to Mill C
  through an overhead passage.</p>

<p align="center">Looking out the window near the steam pipe, one can see a section
  of Mill C which has been recently set afire.</p>

<p align="center">There is a status panel on the other side of the wall from
  one of the the boilers to tell you about various problems that could happen
  to the boiler, such as, &quot;Furnace Draft&quot;, &quot;Burner #1 (or 2) Flame
  Out&quot;, &quot;Low Water Cutout&quot;, &quot;Low Gas Pressure&quot;, &quot;High
  Gas Pressure&quot; (uh-oh!), &quot;High Oil Temp&quot;, &quot;Low Oil Press&quot;, &quot;Low
  Atom Steam Press.&quot;, &quot;Low Water Alarm&quot;, &quot;Low Oxygen&quot;, &quot;High
  Water Alarm&quot;, &quot;F D Fan&quot;, &quot;Instrument Air Press. Plant&quot;,
