<p align="left">Unfortunately, by the time we got to Mill 1, the charge in my
  camera's battery was running very low, so I was not able to obtain many pictures
  of this older portion of the factory complex. By all means feel free to peruse
  the few pictures of Mill 1 that I did get, but for a much more complete tour
  of a mill building, I would suggest taking a look at <a href="/cvantage/mill2/">Mill
  2</a>. </p>
<p align="left">Mill 1 has been out of business for much longer than the more
  modern Mill 2, although I am not sure for how much longer. Mill 1 contains
  two paper machines (at least, we only found two), the Pusey and Horne machines.
  The  Mill 1 complex also includes a testing laboratory and a parchmentizing
  plant, however the parchmentizing plant had been vacant for many years and
  had already been torn down when these pictures were taken.</p>

  On the way to the paper machine room, we found this roomfull of pulping and
other equipment.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4417.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4417.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
Here we have a (rather dark) look along the Pusey machine...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4418.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4418.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
...and one of the Horne machine.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/fullsize/IMG_4419.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4419.jpg" width="384" height="512" border="2"></a><br>
  You really have to love that sticker on the Pusey control panel: &quot;This is a
Non-Profit Organization. It wasn't meant to be that way, but it is.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4420.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4420.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
Here we have the dry end of one of the machines.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4422.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4422.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
...and of the other.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4421.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4421.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
And a look the other way back down the production line.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4423.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4423.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Now somewhere down in the lower levels of Mill 1, we find these stock chests
and pump and agitator motors.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4424.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4424.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>
  A large alum tank rests down here. Alum appears to be another of those popular
paper mill ingredients.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4425.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4425.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>
The lower levels of Mill 1 are dark and massive.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4426.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4426.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  The machinery down here would be better photographed with more light, or a
tripod.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4427.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4427.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  This panel looks like it has something to do with ensuring that there is always
    power available for the &quot;Turbine Aux. Oil Pump,&quot; whatever that is. I wonder
if there used to be another power plant attached to this part of the building...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4431.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4431.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
Coming back upstairs, we find the main laboratory. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4432.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4432.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
It looks like a pretty nice lab.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4428.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4428.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
There are some smaller laboratories in rooms off of the main lab.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4429.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4429.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Perhaps routine testing work was done in the main lab, and experimental research
work was done in these sub-laboratories, or vice-versa.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4430.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4430.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>
The smaller laboratory has a nice view of another part of Mill 1 out its window.</p>
