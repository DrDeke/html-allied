Well, there's the OMC5 coating machine.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4371.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4371.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  And here are the OMC2 and OMC4 machines. I don't really have any idea how a
coating machine operates, therefore I don't have a lot to say about them.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4367.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4367.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
The coating room contains several large tanks, as shown here.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4372.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4372.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  It looks like there's a little bit of... something, left on the floor of this
tank (which incidentally appears to be for sale as its own lot). </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4374.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4374.jpg" width="300" height="400" border="2"></a><br>
  The entire tank
in question.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4373.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4373.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I didn't really want to stick my head in there, so I let the camera do the
job. Here's the top of the inside of the tank.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4376.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4376.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>
Latex sure seems to be a popular ingredient in paper mills.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4377.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4377.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Judging from that sign, I'd say that these are the tanks that directly supply
coating to the OMC4 machine after everything is mixed together.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4380.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4380.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
It looks like sometimes, the coating leaks.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4381.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4381.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
Uggh.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4364.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4364.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>
  I think that this is where the coatings are mixed, &quot;cooked,&quot; and generally
prepared for use.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4365.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4365.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
The coating material seems to leak over here, too.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4362.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4362.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I like this sign. <br>
  (MSDS stands for Material Safety Data Sheets - employers
    have to provide them for just about any chemical that is to be used in the
workplace.)</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4362.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4366.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  These
  look cool, although I can't remember what they were hooked up to or what I
thought they were for.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4350.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4350.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Meet the Balemaster. The Balemaster is in a room very near the coating machine
    room. The management of the mill does not want you to put your head into
the Balemaster. I wouldn't want to put my head in the Balemaster either.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4351.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4351.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  According to this notice, the Balemaster can store a lot of mechanical energy;
    enough to make it move suddenly even if the electricity is turned off. <em>Stored
    mechanical
    energy is bad, and will kill you. </em>*ahem* The Balemaster also seems to
    have some airflow issues, and won't work properly unless the either more
    winders than just the Y-1 are on, or the #5 coater trim blower is turned
    on. But in order to turn that on, a whole bunch of other blowers have to
be turned on. Mm-hmm. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4352.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4352.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
The Balemaster has several sets of control panels.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4353.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4353.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I wonder why this mill needed a Balemaster. I'm pretty sure they didn't manufacture
any pulp-for-sale, but what else would you ship out in bales, I wonder?</p>
