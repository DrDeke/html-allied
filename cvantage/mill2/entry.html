  We had driven by this loading dock and looked inside the open bay door many 
times when the mill was in business, but this time, we get to go inside!</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4063.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4063.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
This is the outside portion of the loading dock through which we entered...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4065.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4065.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
...and the inside portion.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4066.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4066.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Moving a bit farther into the mill, we find several rooms full of equipment 
  that looks like it had been moved there for the auction sale. Or perhaps it 
  had already been purchased and the purchasers had moved it into one place for 
convenient pick-up. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4070.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4070.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
And another room full of auction sale equipment.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4071.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4071.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  This looks like some sort of conveyor like the ones at Circuit City, where they 
  slide your product down from the warehouse section to the pickup counter, only 
heavier-duty.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="tractor"></a><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4067.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4067.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Walking further into the mill, we find a sign telling us that &quot;Tractor 
Damage Creates Waste Which is DOLLAR$&quot;.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4074.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4074.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
It looks like we located the Men's Room...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4076.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4076.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  It looks like they were pretty serious about people not using the toilets, which 
was probably a good idea, since the water was turned off to the building.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4075.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4075.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Not too many heating radiators that I've seen have pressure gages attached to 
them; this one obviously being an exception.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4077.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4077.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
All of the mill's forklifts were lined up here for the sale.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4082.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4082.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I guess we see who gets all the respect around this mill, with air conditioners 
in virtually every office...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4084.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4084.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  ...those offices being cooled at the expense of everyone else, since most of 
the air conditioners simply vent the heat out into the factory floor!</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4096.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4096.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
On the way upstairs to find one of the machine rooms, one encounters this ramp.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4097.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4097.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Presumably, finished rolls were brought down this ramp by forklift from the
machine room to the warehouse or shipping area.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4098.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4098.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I guess they don't want people getting run over by forklifts loaded with paper
rolls.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4099.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4099.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>
Here is what appears to be another small storage area at the top of the ramp.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4103.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4103.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Straight ahead is the Bagley paper machine, with the Beloit machine to its
    left. To our right are some offices which contained some interesting documents
pertaining to the operation of the various paper machines in the mill.</p>
