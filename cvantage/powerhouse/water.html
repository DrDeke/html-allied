  At power plants, a lot of work goes into treating and preparing the water that 
  is to be used in the boilers. This section of the plant contains the equipment 
that is used for doing this.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4231.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4231.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Such as this &quot;Hot Lime Softener.&quot; When we obtained our previous tour 
  of this power plant, the water treatment equipment was one of the few systems 
still running, and it sure did generate a lot of noise and heat.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4232.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4232.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
The Hot Lime Softener is rather tall.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4234.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4234.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I suppose these pipes carry the water and chemicals around to and from the various 
pieces of equipment.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4235.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4235.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  There is a small laboratory type room next to the Hot Lime Softener, which contains, 
among other things, the &quot;Water Purity Analyzer&quot; shown in the picture.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4236.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4236.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  It also contains a lab bench, and a list of pager and phone numbers, presumably 
of people who worked at the plant.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4237.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4237.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  A laboratory room seems like a funny place to put switchgear, but there it stands 
nonetheless.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4238.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4238.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> 
  <br>
  In the space below the Hot Lime Softener, one finds an insulated tank of some 
kind.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4239.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4239.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> 
  <br>
  Here, Sean pauses to inspect something downstairs, while I gaze once again at 
the upper workings of the Hot Lime Softener:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4241.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4241.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4244.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4244.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  This tank bears a striking resemblance to a couple of the tanks in the powerhouse 
of the Allied paper mill.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4323.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4323.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  These tanks are insulated so as to avoid heat loss from their contents. Typically,
     water about to be fed into a boiler is pre-heated with what would otherwise
    
  have been waste heat from either steam condensates or boiler furnace exhaust
    gases. The goal is to get as much heat/energy as possible out of the fuel
    you burn,
    
that way you don't have to pay for as much fuel.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4330.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4330.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
My guess is that those pipes were designed to carry hot feedwater.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4331.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4331.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Yeah, well, I wouldn't want to go in there without a permit (and some lockouts) 
either.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4332.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4332.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
I'm not really sure what this thing is.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4333.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4333.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I guess we're not supposed to operate whatever that pipe is connected to anymore. 
  So the saying, &quot;Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!&quot; doesn't 
apply in this situation.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4334.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4334.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  Under the turbine room now, this appears to be the feed or exhaust steam pipe 
for one of the turbines.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4335.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4335.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  That's an interesting pipe, with those springs or shock absorbers or whatever 
they are sticking out of it!</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4336.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4336.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I guess the idea of a turbogenerator falling through the floor didn't appeal 
to everyone. Hence, these substantial looking arches.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4337.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4337.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I don't know if those are condensate pumps, or pumps of some other variety. 
They look like they're in pretty nice shape though.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4338.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4338.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  That is one of the nastier looking sump-pump wells I have seen. I'm sure glad 
  they didn't just pump that straight into the ground or the river or anything 
like that. Oh, wait...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4320.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4320.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
This apparatus was humming away when we were there.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4325.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4325.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  It looks like this is where they once loaded the coal off the train and into 
  the plant. This particular plant had converted from coal to natural gas many 
years ago. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4324.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4324.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
The coal pit's drain seems to have fallen into a state of disrepair.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4327.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4327.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
Some plants are taking over the coal pit walls.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4328.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4328.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
And a small bog seems to have formed in the bottom of the pit.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4329.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4329.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  I think that is one walkway from which I will &quot;Keep Off,&quot; thank you 
very much!</p>
