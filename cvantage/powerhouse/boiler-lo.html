  The Crown Vantage Powerhouse has two large boilers and one small boiler; this 
  is one of the two large ones. The boilers were fired by coal when the mill was 
  built, but they were later converted to natural gas.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4441.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4441.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  And the upper portion of this boiler.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4446.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4446.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  And an explorer perched in its upper reaches.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4445.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4445.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>

  Here's a look across the upper portion of the boiler room from the top of the 
  large boiler.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

  And, the top of the large boiler. We were told by some former power plant employees 
  that by the time the steam reaches this point, it is so dry and so superheated 
  that when the pipes start leaking, you can't see the steam escaping at all. 
  In order to find the leak, you have to put a rag at the end of a long stick 
  and brush it by the areas of the pipes that you think might be leaking. When 
  the rag bursts into flames, you've found the leak.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4450.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4450.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  And now, the actual top of the boiler.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4452.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4452.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  Here's one of the smokestacks heading up to the outside.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4451.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4451.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  And some other large thing having to do with the boiler exhaust. Perhaps the 
  superheater is inside of there or something.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4453.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4453.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  Climbing back down the boiler scaffolding...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4444.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4444.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  Back down on the main level, we see what appears to be an induced draft blower, 
  which sucks the combustion gases out of the boiler and blows them into the smokestack.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4443.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4443.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  And here we have the ubiquitous power plant curved steam pipe up near the ceiling.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4297.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4297.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  Here are some pipes and equipment at the firing end of one of the large boilers.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4298.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4298.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  And some more stuff right next to that.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4299.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4299.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  And here we have some control equipment for &quot;Boiler No. 10.&quot; Now, 
  why this is called the number 10 boiler, when there are only three boilers in 
  the building, is a bit beyond me.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4310.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4310.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  And this, I believe, is the very bottom of firing side of the boiler, down in 
  the basement. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4311.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4311.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  Back on the main floor, here we have a look across the entire boiler room, with 
  some of the control equipment for the smaller heating boiler in the foreground. 
</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4312.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4312.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
  This large pit with a safety railing around it goes all the way down to the 
  basement, where a number of barrels stand. I wonder if there used to be more 
  equpment (such as another boiler) where this pit now is, or whether it was always 
  vacant - perhaps as room for future expansion if more power was needed in the 
  future. </p>
