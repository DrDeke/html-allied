  We just had to go ahead and authorize ourselves to enter the power plant's control 
room...</p>

...where we found this rather impressive array of control and monitoring equipment.</p>

  This indicator panel seemed to indicate that there were a lot of problems with 
  the boilers and other systems. Also, the saturated steam pressure looked a little 
low :).</p>

  I asked if they wanted me to fire up the plant one last time, but they said 
no.</p>

Sean couldn't get the plant started up either.</p>

  Hmm, five sets of indicators going up to 20 Megawatts, 4800 Volts, 2000 Amperes. 
  I guess these weren't the circuits that handled the small stuff! I wonder if 
  the two circuits there that read 4800 volts were actually energized. I mean, 
  the lights and some of the equipment was active, so I guess they could have 
been...</p>

<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4283.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4283.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
There was some pretty nice fiber/ethernet telecom equipment in there, too.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4286.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4286.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  There are many controls, chart recorders and indicators in this room, the remainder 
  of which can be viewed by clicking on the link at the bottom of this page, because 
we're now going to move on to the other end of the control room.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4291.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4291.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  At the far end of the control room was another room containing more control 
gear and a couple of operator computer stations...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4340.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4340.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
Such as this dual-monitor SPARCstation 5.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4341.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4341.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  And this single-monitor SPARCstation 5. Both of these SPARCstations were mounted 
next to these other machines called WEStations.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"> <a href="photo/1024/IMG_4254.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4254.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  The rightmost SPARCstation, WEStation, and related equipment. The WEStations 
  appeared to be some kind of interface between the SPARCstations and the Westinghouse 
  Distributed Processing Family equipment in the cabinets on the other side of 
the room:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4293.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4293.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
These are the Westinghouse cabinets in question.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4251.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4251.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
Here are some of the innards of one of the Westinghouse cabinets.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4253.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4253.jpg" width="384" height="512" border="2"></a><br>
And the innards of another.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4461-e1.jpg"><img src="photo/IMG_4461-e1.jpg" width="450" height="580" border="2"></a><br>
  The backup power supply to one of the operator stations still had some juice 
  in it. The computer didn't have any kind of login/password system either, so 
  we were able to access some interesting screens, like the one above.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4461.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4461.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
You just don't see things like this every day. Which is too bad.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/IMG_4457.jpg"><img src="photo/512/IMG_4457.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>
  As you can see from the LED bar graph, the UPS' battery was pretty much giving 
its last hurrah, so we didn't get to operate the computer for very long.</p>
