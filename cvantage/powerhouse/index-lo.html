<p align="left">The Crown Vantage Powerhouse was the last building to go when
  the mill was permanently shut down. The powerhouse was kept running to provide
  heat for the mill for several months after the mill was finally shut down on
  November 3rd, 2003, in the hope that a buyer could be found to operate the
  mill once again. However, no buyer was found, and the powerhouse was eventually
  shut down as well.</p>
<p align="left">A few weeks before the powerhouse ceased operating, I knocked
  on its door and spoke with one of the last few people who worked there. I guess
  he knew he really had nothing to lose in terms of job security (or maybe it
  wouldn't have mattered anyway), so he was kind enough to give me a brief tour
  of the powerhouse. Although only the small heating boiler was operating at
  the time, the operation of the plant was still quite a sight to see. </p>
<p align="left">At the time of the powerhouse's closing, it contained one small
  and two large natural gas fired boilers, a 9.375MW turbogenerator, another
   turbogenerator of similar size (although unknown exact output), equipment
  to distribute steam to the mill buildings for heat and for paper machine operation,
  a water treatment plant (for the boiler feedwater), and the other various auxiliary
  equipment necessary for the operation of a power plant. The plant also contained
  equipment providing an electrical interconnection with Consumers' Energy, the
  local utility company. The powerhouse was then 
  responsible for the distribution of electricity, heat, and machine steam to
  the entire paper mill complex. </p>
<p align="left">None of the equipment in the powerhouse (with the possible exception
  of some machinery in the boiler room) appears to have been altered or removed
  between its shutdown and June of 2003 when I took these pictures. At the time
  these pictures were taken, the auction personnel had evidently turned on a
  few more circuits than just those providing lighting, so the noise of a few
  small machines in various areas of the powerhouse was audible, adding to the
  general atmosphere of the place.</p>
