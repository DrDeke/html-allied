    We think that this room once contained work areas with machine tools and stuff, 
    which were probably used to manufacture and/or repair parts to be used elsewhere 
    in the mill.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010019.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010019.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Looking out the workshop window, one sees the main shipping/receiving and 
    warehouse section of Mill C.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010020.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010020.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Another look at the workshop room. The freight elevator appears in the background.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010021.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010021.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    There is an office in a corner of the workshop room, perhaps that of some 
    kind of supervisor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010022.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010022.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    This corridor coming off of the workshop room leads to a series of offices 
    on the left and laboratories (for testing, quality assurance, etc.) on the 
    right. Farther ahead down the corridor beyond the firewall is the portion 
    of Mill C which someone or some group of people set on fire during October(?) 
    of 2001. It used to contain many more offices, but is now completely unenterable. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010023.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010023.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    This is one of the fomer laboratories in that front corridor. That is a <em>really 
    nice</em> looking fume hood back there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010024.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010024.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Laboratories within laboratories...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010029.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010029.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    One finds this machine, a beta-ray gage, in another one of the laboratories. 
    A beta-ray gage evidently uses beta-particle radiation in order to test and 
    determine the properties of a piece of paper. Somebody has kindly written 
    some &quot;Do Not Touch / Danger / Do Not Open&quot; warnings on the machine. 
    If true and legitimate, these types of warnings could be quite helpful for 
    people wishing to avoid getting hurt. However, some people have a tendency 
    to grossly exaggerate the &quot;dangers&quot; of various things in abandoned 
    buildings in an attempt to make themselves feel important and to make others 
    think that they are knowledgeable and important. In my opinion, this is a 
    disgusting thing to do, as it needlessly scares people away from situations 
    that are not truly dangerous, but may fail to warn people from something that 
    truly <em>is</em> dangerous. As for the safety of the beta-ray gage, well... 
    We don't really know, so we didn't mess with it (not that we would have done 
    otherwise anyway). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010033.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010033.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    The laboratories are quite extensive and at one time must have been quite 
    nice.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010035.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010035.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a> 
    <br>
    Yet another laboratory bench and fume hood.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010036.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010036.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Well, somebody prior to our visit decided not to heed the warning marked on 
    the side of the beta-ray gage, because here is the machine's back panel, all 
    opened up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010040.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010040.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Some of the laboratories (such as this one) contain chart recorders. I wonder 
    what statistic this particular unit was used to record.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010041.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010041.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    At the end of the corridor, one can peer into the burned out section of Mill 
    C beyond the firewall.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010042.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010042.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    We're glad that the firewall saved the rest of the mill, but was it really 
    necessary for whoever set this building on fire to have done so? Why do people 
    have to be so stupidly destructive? The local news reported that the police 
    believed that the building was purposely set afire, so it's not too likely 
    that this was an accident...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010038.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010038.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    On the way back down the corridor, one finds several offices facing the front 
    of the building.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010028.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010028.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    Another office, whose window is still intact.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/millc/1024/P1010043.jpg"><img src="photo/millc/P1010043.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a><br>
    One of the offices contains this leftover EGA screen sender; a device that 
    sends the content of an EGA computer monitor over a serial line, to be decoded 
    and displayed on the other end (for instance, on a display on the factory 
    floor or in a supervisor's office).</p>
