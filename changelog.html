I would like to obtain additional coverage in some areas, and if   I get a chance to do this, I will update the grounds tour with them.</p><p align="left"><strong>05 Jan 2003:</strong><br>  Added a link to Jeremy Winkworth's fine <a href="http://www.winkworth.us/alliedpaper/">Allied   Paper</a> site, featuring Allied photos from the year 1980.</p><p align="left"><strong>30 Dec 2002:</strong><br>  Finally acquired some images of <a href="/millc.html">Mill C</a> and created   a Mill C section for the site.</p><p align="left"><strong>15 Dec 2002: <br>  </strong>I migrated the site to a new server.

Demaine e-mailed me with a bunch of information   about things in the mill a number of weeks ago. Today, I added all of this information   to the site. The information is interspersed throughout the website near the   photograph that it concerns. I also added the information from a different individual's   26 Sep 2002 e-mail to the main site. (It had been below in concentrated format   only before.)</p><p align="left"><strong>01 Oct 2002:</strong><br>  Tweaked the contrast and brightness of the 1024x768 Mill D photos that needed   it (as had already been done for their 400x300 conterparts).</p><p align="left"><strong>29 Sep 2002:</strong><br>  Added 1024x768 links to all of the Mill D photos.</p><p align="left"><strong>26 Sep 2002:<br>  </strong>Redesigned front page. Added changelog. Added discussion forums. Began   adding the following information which I had previously received about the contents   of Mill D and the Powerhouse:</p><p align="left"><font size="-1">It was confirmed by someone working in the paper   industry that the <a href="/powerhouse4.html#cyl">two strange cylinders</a> that   we thought had something to do with the treatment of the boiler feedwater indeed   are used for this purpose. Specifically, we are told that they de-mineralize   the water, which is more or less what we had speculated. </font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">We are also told that <a href="/powerhouse4.html#causticsoda">caustic   soda</a> is often used to break down wood fiber into paper pulp. (A 10% mixture   of sodium hydroxide is commonly known as white pulping liquor.) This is a bit   unusual, since to our knowledge, the only on-site souce of pulp was the paper   recycling operation, not an actual wood-fed pulp mill. We had thought that part   of the reason the factory was unprofitable was due to the lack of an integrated   pulp mill. Perhaps we were wrong, but I am pretty sure that there was not an   on-site pulp mill. Perhaps caustic soda is also used in the paper recycling   process, or if that is not the case, perhaps it was there for use in some other   general mill or power plant related task. Further <a href="mailto:allied@alliedpaper.org">clarification</a>   on this topic by someone in the know would be appreciated.</font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">We were also told that the scale on the sides   of the <a href="/powerhouse6.html#scale">No. 1 boiler</a> look like lime scale,   which would be the result of the boiler having been used to reclaim (burn) pulping   liquor from an onsite pulp mill in addition to its regular fuels. Most modern   mills do this, as it reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be purchased,   and is also a convenient method of disposing of the waste liquor. However, as   said earlier, it is thought that there was not a pulp mill at Allied Paper.   The same alternate scenarios apply however: we could be wrong about the lack   of a pulp mill, or the liquors reclaimed in the boiler may have been a product   of the recycling process. Alternatively, perhaps it is possible that the boiler   was used to reclaim liquors from a different paper mill (seems unlikely), or   that the scale came from some other process than the reclamation of pulping   liquors.</font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">Evidently, the <a href="/powerhouse4.html#sink">odd   sink</a> is designed the way it is so that multiple people can use it at once   (this could come in handy at break times and quitting time I imagine). We are   told that the faucet head is at the top and the water comes out like from a   garden hose attachment spraying in a circle. I would like to have seen that   sink in action.</font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">We are told that the picture of what we labelled   a &quot;Beater&quot; in Mill D is actually known as a broke beater chest, or   broke beater tank. Evidently, &quot;broke&quot; paper is paper that has already   been made into paper in the paper machine, but for one reason or another is   being re-pulped (we do not know why this is done - perhaps if the quality of   the paper is less than desired or there was some kind of mistake in the paper   making process - or perhaps it is for other reasons). We are told that the broke   beater is a large tank filled with &quot;white water&quot;, which is water that   has been in the paper machine once and is being recycled (it dripped out through   the paper machine mesh in the early stages, I think?), and has a large spinning   blade at the bottom to cut the paper up. Then, once the broke is at the correct   consistency, it is pumped back to the paper machine to be made into a new roll.</font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">I am not quite clear about what was meant by some   of the things in the above paragraph. My understanding would be that the broke   beater contains <em>both</em> white water, and the semi-finished paper from   the machine that is being recycled; and the blade chops up the paper until it   sort of dissolves in or becomes integrated with the white water (since both   are made of pulp originally). If someone could <a href="mailto:allied@alliedpaper.org">let   us know</a> whether that is correct, or if I've got it wrong, that would be   really great. Also, I am not quite sure which piece of equipment was being discussed.   Perhaps it is <a href="/milld.html#beater1">this</a> machine which we did call   a &quot;Beater&quot; in our writeup, or maybe they meant <a href="/milld-4.html#brokepulper">this</a>   one. The bin in the second link there definately does not drop into the machine   in the first link - they are in different parts of the factory. However, I do   not know where exactly the bin does drop to, and maybe what it drops into is   a machine similar to the machine in the first link. But, when looking down the   bin labeled Broke Pulper, it does not really look much like whatever the machine   in the first link is. So again, we would sure appreciate <a href="mailto:allied@alliedpaper.org">more   explanation</a>. (I'm not joking when I say I knew nothing about the paper industry   before finding this mill.) </font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">It was pointed out that the items in the picture   of the &quot;<a href="/milld-3.html#indroom">industrial room containing lots   of strange things</a>&quot; are boxes of 5.5 or 5 and 1/16 inch core plugs for   the cardboard tubes that go through the center of a roll of paper. These plugs   are used to keep the cores from crushing under the weight of the paper during   the stress of shipment. </font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">We are told that <a href="/milld-3.html#latexclay">Latex</a>   is used in the making of milk cartons (not bottles), which may have been one   of the paper products made at the mill. This is a very good explanation for   the presence of the latex, which was quite puzzling to me previously. We were   told further that the <a href="/milld-3.html#latexclay">clay</a> is used as   a filler (sometimes up to 18%) in some grades of paper because it is cheaper   than wood fiber.</font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">It was confirmed that at least some of the ceramic   tile lined objects are indeed called pulp chests. I think that <a href="/milld-3.html#pulpchests">these</a>   were the specific items being referred to, although there are many tile-lined   containers and machines in different shapes throughout the paper mill. It was   said that ceramic tile is the only practical material that can stand up to the   abrasive nature of paper pulp, so it makes sense that not only the storage chests,   but also the other tanks and machines that store pulp in various stages of manufacture   are also lined with tile. </font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">Some light has also been shed on the strange looking   <a href="/milld-6.html#conveyor">conveyor apparatus</a>. It was suggested that   this was probably a conveyor for waste paper that was about to be recycled to   go up and into a broke chest or more likely (if this was indeed general received   paper for recycling), a de-inker. It is known that there was a recycling and   de-inking operation at this factory, so this explanation makes a lot of sense.   If this was the case, then the top of the conveyor probably is over the <a href="/milld-6.html#pit">pit</a>   in the room (which I was not able to tell for sure about from the photographs),   and that the de-inker was once installed in or on the pillars in the pit. </font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1">Finally, we were told that the &quot;<a href="/milld-6.html#kraft">rolls   of cruddy looking paper</a>&quot; strewn about the floor are called Kraft paper,   which is a semi-waterproof wrapping paper (presumably used to wrap the rolls   of finished paper in for shipping - or perhaps they were products made at the   mill for sale as well).</font></p><p align="left">That is the end of the changes made at this time. I will soon   begin the process of integrating some of this information into the regular mill   tour pages.</p></body></html>
