  <p>A logbook detailing the operation of the Powerhouse during May, June and 
    July of 1987 was found in an upstairs office and has been reproduced photographically 
    for our reading enjoyment. </p>
  <p>For easier reading, I have transcribed the logbook pages into text. The page 
    image may be viewed by clicking on the link for the date in question. Some 
    of the text is difficult to read and some portions of the pages have been 
    smudged or obliterated by being stepped on with dirty shoes. Unknown words 
    or partial words are noted by dashes (---), unsure words and letters are noted 
    by (?).</p>
