Beyond   the fence is the former millpond and waste disposal areas. There were also more   mill buildings back there at one time. The entire area is now fenced off because   of the pollution - the area is contaminated with PCBs from de-inking of carbonless   copy paper which used to be made with PCBs. Originally, these chemicals were   just dumped into the millpond. Later on in the operation of the mill, the waste   water would be &quot;treated&quot; and then the residuals from the treatment   process were put in a landfill, which evidently formed the banks of the river.   Smooth thinking, there. Crews are currently working to deploy measures intended   to prevent the further erosion of these residuals into the river.</font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/115-1564_IMG.jpg" width="400" height="300"><br>  <font size="-1">These days, the water just flows through on its merry way...</font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/115-1568_IMG.jpg" width="400" height="300"><br>  <font size="-1">...and under the road over toward Mill C.</font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">And here's the front (the southern side) of Mill C (the Bryant   Mill) as it exists today, looking from left to right:</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/IMG_0010.jpg" width="400" height="300"><br>  <font size="-1">The left-most portion of the mill, along with an extremely large   tank (I wonder what that used to hold - fresh water to be used in a manufacturing   process? used process water awaiting treatment? some chemical?). You can also   see the viaduct which runs all the way to the right to the powerhouse. To the   left of the photograph, it currently terminates when it reaches the street,   but it used to run across the street to the other mill buildings or perhaps   to the water treatment buildings.</font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/IMG_0002.jpg" width="400" height="300"><br>  <font size="-1">The portion of Mill C visible in this picture consists mostly   of office and laboratory space, at least on the upper floor. This portion of   the mill was set on fire on October 18th, 2001, as you can probably see from   the burn marks coming out of the windows and the missing/burned portion of the   wall in the middle of the photo. We don't know what is in the basement   of this portion of the mill since we've never gone down there, and probably   never will now that it has been damaged so badly by the fire. </font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/IMG_0003.jpg" width="400" height="300"><br>  <font size="-1">Here's the business portion of the mill - most of the manufacturing   areas and such are in this section of the building. The main warehouse/storage   room can be seen to the far right.</font></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/IMG_0006.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p><p align="center"><img src="photo/grounds/IMG_0009.jpg" width="400" height="300"><br>  <font size="-1">The size of this warehouse building/room (it's just one large   room inside) is staggering.
