  <p>On the way up the ramp, one finds two rather humorous pieces of grafitti.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2590.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2590.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2" alt="Graffiti: Paper or Perish"></a></p>
  <p>So which one does this mill fall under?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2589.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2589.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>At the top of the ramp is this freight elevator, which is in rather bad shape.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2591.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2591.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a> 
  </p>
  <p>This probably wasn't the original location of this pump (if that's what it 
    is). C. Demaine confirms that it is indeed a pump, coupling, and electric 
    motor (to drive the pump). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2592.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2592.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>A bunch of pipe lengths are stacked up and there is a bunch of powder on 
    the floor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2594.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2594.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>I wonder what they were doing there. Well, I wondered until it was pointed 
    out by someone in the industry that these are probably not pipes, but cardboard 
    paper tubes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2595.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2595.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Near some windows looking out on the creek, one finds a tank on a raised 
    cement block.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2598.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2598.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>A broken half-bag of some chemical sits in the corner doing its thing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2599.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2599.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Proceeding a bit more towards the front of the mill, one runs into this rather 
    new-looking contraption.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2600.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2600.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>C. Demaine and others have informed us that this device is a Sentrol paper 
    sheet scanner, used to determine the characteristics of a paper sheet for 
    quality-control purposes. Some are optical, but this particular one uses a 
    radioactive source and detector to perform its measurements - however, the 
    radioactive source on this particular machine has been removed (luckily). 
    I find it curious that there was no NRC plaque on the machine (at least not 
    on the part we saw), but perhaps it was removed when the radioactive source 
    was removed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2602.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2602.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the flash created quite a glare on the control panel for this 
    device, but on the larger image, some of the writing should be legible.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2609.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2609.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>On the powerhouse-side of the mill, is a horizontal tank with a &quot;Calgon 
    Bulk Liquid Service&quot; logo on it. Perhaps this is the tank filled by the 
    &quot;Waste Treatment Polymer&quot; fillport that is visible on the front 
    of Mill D. (One wonders what exactly was treated with the waste treatment 
    polymer, and what the polymer was.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2601.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2601.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>The floor drain grates/troughs run here as they do through the rest of the 
    lower floor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2605.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2605.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>The gas that this meter measured was perhaps used to run some various water 
    and other heating devices found in Mill D. At least, I assume it may have 
    been so, as the paper machines themselves were almost certainly run off of 
    steam and electricity, and the former Mill D power plant was nowhere near 
    this meter. I do wonder, though, why the heaters were not also run off of 
    steam -- but perhaps at one point, the boilers were operating at maximum capacity 
    and additional heating was needed, which would be a good reason to use gas 
    equipment. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2606.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2606.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>It seems like a funny place for a shower... <br>
    (But C. Demaine notes that the presence of a safety shower usually indicates 
    that there were nasty chemicals in use nearby. I had not considered this to be 
    a safety shower, none of the safety showers I've seen were enclosed or had 
    curtains on them, but perhaps this is what it is. It would certainly explain 
    why the shower was located here.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2607.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2607.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Near the shower are these cubicles; they were probably either part storage 
    bins or personal storage for employees.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2612.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2612.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>This part of the Mill contains lots of horizontal tanks.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2615.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2615.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2614.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2614.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>And some more electrical stuff. C. Demaine adds that this is a bank of Allen 
    Bradley MCCs (Motor Control Centers), and that someone has removed all of 
    their innards, although they wouldn't be worth that much.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2618.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2618.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Here's one of the front doors to the mill.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2622.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2622.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>And a spiral staircase going up.</p>
