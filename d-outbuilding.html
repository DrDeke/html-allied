Notice the smokestack behind the outbuilding     - it was once the smokestack for the boilers for the Mill D powerplant; but     that has been torn down, and the base of the smokestack is now outdoors. The     building in the picture that we will explore is quite near the base of the     smokestack, and it is my guess that it was directly connected to the actual     powerplant building, and may have even contained some or all of the plant's     turbines. (The boilers, of course, would have been in the actual building     containing the stack.)</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2495.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2495.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>  <p>Entering the building... &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2496.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2496.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>  <p>The first thing one sees when walking in the door is this rather large and     rather rusted engine.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2498.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2498.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a>   </p>  <p>Given the condition of the roof, it's a wonder that this building and its     contents are in as good of shape as they are.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2503.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2503.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>  <p>The building contains one paper machine roller that looks almost brand-new...</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2505.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2505.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>  <p>...and several which do not.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2506.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2506.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>  <p>Another engine, this one in front of a window with a rather nice view.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2509.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2509.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>  <p>The windows on that side of the building look out on Portage Creek, and the     main Mill D building.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2510.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2510.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>  <p>The building we're in contains a basement, which we chose not to enter, for     obvious reasons.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2512.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2512.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>  <p>Many more machine rollers are in this part of the building. I wonder if they     were stored or repaired in this building, or if they were just dumped here     for some reason. Also curious is the fact that they haven't been scrapped     - they're probably made of steel, and they look pretty substantial.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="d-outbuilding2.html">Proceed further into the building.</a></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
