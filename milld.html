  <p>Our chosen entrance to the Mill D complex deposits us on the lowest (full) 
    level of the mill. This level of the mill contains troughs dug into the floor, 
    mainly near the creek, but going all over the building, that lead to two wells 
    containing sump pumps. There is certainly no power to the pumps now, and although 
    the wells contained some water, the troughs were dry. Given the proximity 
    of the building to the creek, this is probably not the case when the water 
    level is higher. Mill D is constructed in the fashion of a &quot;walkout basement&quot; 
    -- the level at which we enter is at the ground level on this side of the 
    mill, but if you walk straight through this door across to the other side 
    of the mill, you will be approximately one story below ground.</p>

  <p>Having moved across the catwalk but not yet into the building, one can see 
    that the area between Mill D and the creek is pretty cluttered with pipes, 
    valves and conduits.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A device known as a Beater greets entrants to the mill. </p>
  <p><a name="beater1"></a></p>

  <p>Water and chemicals are poured into a beater, then bales or sheets of pulp 
    are added and mixed into a pulp slurry through the action of that large.... 
    thing. (It is rotated by a big motor).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I think the beater looks pretty cool. In one of the small power substations 
    on the factory grounds, a label references the &quot;200-ton Beater in Mill 
    D&quot;, although I doubt that this is the unit being discussed there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2578.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2578.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Pipes 'n stuff.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2582.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2582.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Correction: <em>Most</em> of the troughs are dry. This one obviously is not.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2585.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2585.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>It looks to me like part of an automatic transmission on a car. People do 
    sometimes junk stuff in here, so perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn't.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2583.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2583.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>One medium sized tank with ladder, which did not get climbed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As we take a quick peek at the other side (the side by the Powerhouse) of 
    the mill, things get more and more messy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2551.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2551.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>A bit towards the front of the mill from the beater is one of the sump pumps. 
    As you can see from the position of the float, if the mill had power, the 
    pump would be on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2587.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2587.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Although there is much more building towards the rear of the mill from where 
    we entered, it was pretty dark back there, and so we did not visit it on this 
    trip. The ramp above leads to the front section of Mill D.</p>
