<p><font size="-1">Since its inception in 1910, the Watervliet Paper Company has 
  been the backbone of the small town of Watervliet, MI. Unfortunately, as with 
  so many paper factories in the area, the mill shut down in the mid-1990s, leaving 
  many people out of work and leaving the town's industrial center an abandoned 
  toxic mess. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The mill was finally torn down between November 2001 and May 
  2002. But, before this happened, my friends and I took a few trips to the mill 
  and were able to take some pictures of the place so that it may be preserved, 
  at least in memory.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Since I don't have enough photos to make up a real &quot;tour&quot; 
  of this mill, I am not going to write up as detailed a commentary as with the 
  Allied Paper tours, since there really isn't that much to comment on. I may 
  be able to obtain some additional images from a video tape I have that was made 
  at this factory; once I add those, there may be enough material for a bit more 
  narrative.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">All photographs on this page have been generously supplied 
  by S. Caron.</font></p>
<p align="left">We'll start with some shots of the south side of the factory (for 
  some reason I don't have any photos of the factory's front along main street):</p>

<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/turbine-sign.jpg"><img src="photo/turbine-sign.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a><br>
  Just inside the above garage-style door is this sign warning employees about 
  valves and the B turbine.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/mess.jpg"><img src="photo/mess.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a><br>
  Looking inside this garage on the south side of the mill, one sees that it is 
  quite a mess in there.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/blue-building.jpg"><img src="photo/blue-building.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a></p>

<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/loading-dock-and-truck.jpg"><img src="photo/loading-dock-and-truck.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a><br>
  The day these pictures were taken, there were some people loading things from 
  the factory into this truck, and some old pickup trucks. They didn't seem to 
  want to bother us (which was very nice of them in our opinion), so we didn't 
  bother them. I have read that for a time, ownership of the factory fell into 
  the hands of a local family, so perhaps these people were that family and/or 
  their friends attempting to salvage some material from the mill.</p>

<p align="left">Now around to the north side of the mill:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/mill-front.jpg"><img src="photo/mill-front.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a></p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/mill-front-two.jpg"><img src="photo/mill-front-two.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a></p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/mill-front-three.jpg"><img src="photo/mill-front-three.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a></p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/office-door.jpg"><img src="photo/office-door.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a><br>
  This door on the mill's north side looks inviting.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/columns.jpg"><img src="photo/columns.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a><br>
  There's a room behind it, with a number of very sturdy columns.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/door-eight.jpg"><img src="photo/door-eight.jpg" width="400" height="570" border="2"></a><br>
  Upstairs from the column room are a number of doors, such as this one. Although 
  it was not between 5PM and 8AM when we were there, we respected the sign's instructions 
  anyway so we do not know what is behind this door (door #8).</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/whiteboard-vandalism.jpg"><img src="photo/whiteboard-vandalism.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a><br>
  Across from door #8 was an office containing this whiteboard which had been 
  graffiti'd. </p>

<p align="left">Heading now around to the rear of the factory:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/mill-rear.jpg"><img src="photo/mill-rear.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a></p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/mill-rear-closeup.jpg"><img src="photo/mill-rear-closeup.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a></p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/enclave.jpg"><img src="photo/enclave.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a><br>
  Here's the interesting part! Look at all that stuff.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="photo/1024/rail-loading-dock.jpg"><img src="photo/rail-loading-dock.jpg" width="400" height="281" border="2"></a><br>
  At the very back of the mill is this rail loading area, which was used to unload 
  coal for the powerhouse, and was probably also used to load finished paper to 
  be shipped out.</p>
