Here is what I found:</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp; </p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7015.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7015.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>    A big chunk of Mill C is missing.</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7019.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7019.jpg" width="512" height="683" border="2"></a> <br>    It feels strange to be able to see this much of the power plant from Alcott street.</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7021.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7021.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>    It looks like they're tearing through Mill C pretty rapidly.</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7029.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7029.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>    They've got a pretty good start on Mill C's large warehouse, too.

There is (or was) a large basement area underneath this warehouse, containing a lot of equipment and also a locker room. Unfortunately, we only discovered this area quite recently and did not get any pictures of it. </p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7077.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7077.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>  One can see the roof structure of the giant warehouse.</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7078.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7078.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>    The tank is in even worse condition on this side.

It would have been fun to have tried to find that pipe's entrance in the basement of Mill C and see where it went or what it was connected to. I probably would have done this if someone hadn't BURNED THAT PART OF MILL C DOWN (sigh). </p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7081.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7081.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>    It looks like they didn't even bother removing some of the machinery before they started tearing into the warehouse.</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7085.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7085.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>    I wonder when they are going to dismantle those connectors between the power plant, Mill C and Mill D.</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7087.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7087.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a> <br>    I don't know what they've been doing inside the Powerhouse and Mill D, but none of the exterior demolition has started.</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7096.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7096.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>    That metal cage (which was formerly guarding the connection between the fire hydrant and the garden hose to Mill C) looks kind of familiar...</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><a href="photo/demolition2/1024/IMG_7095.jpg"><img src="photo/demolition2/512/IMG_7095.jpg" width="512" height="384" border="2"></a><br>    Oh yeah, it's the container of Keydime C222 from Akzo Nobel that used to be sitting in the portion of Mill C just up the hill from here! Akzo/Eka's <a href="http://www.eka.com/Eka/Businesses/PP/Sizing/Internal+Sizing.htm">Keydime C</a> product line is a line of synthetic internal sizing chemicals which are stabilized with cationic starch.
