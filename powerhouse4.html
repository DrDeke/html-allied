      <td align="center" valign="top"><p>As one exits the switchgear area, one enters a large, 
          open room. This room contains some boiler feedwater treatment machinery, 
          an office, a door leading to a chemical storage/mixing room, and a hallway 
          which leads to a large loading door and to a washroom.</p>

        <p>Two strange cylinders that we think have to do with softening and otherwise 
          preparing feedwater for the boilers (it has now been confirmed by someone 
          who works in the &quot;forest products&quot; industry, that these cylinders 
          are indeed pieces of demineralizing equipment). If boiler feedwater 
          is not treated properly, it reduces the life of the boiler considerably 
          (due to corrosion, scaling, etc..), reduces efficiency, increases the 
          need for maintenance, and can lead to dangerous situations by causing 
          temperature and pressure sensors and automatic shutoff devices to malfunction.</p>

        <p>On the other side of the room from those very tall cylinders, there
          are these other tanks with lots of piping attached to them. They look
      rather cool, but I don't have any idea what they were used for.</p></td>

  <p>Some wise people decided to take bags of chemicals (caustic soda, and something
    else that I can't remember) from an adjoining room and break them open and
    strew them about the room. They also acquired a bunch of those circular chart-recorder
    papers, probably from one of the nearby offices, and have strewn them all
    over, too. What geniuses.</p>

  <p>The bottom of one of those large cylinders.</p>

  <p>The bottom of the other large cylinder.</p>
  <p><a name="causticsoda"></a></p>

  <p>Here are some stacked up bags of chemicals in the chemical mixing room adjacent
    to the main (water treatment) room. Some of the bags contain caustic soda
    (sodium hydroxide), and others contain some other chemical, the identity
    of which currently eludes me. According to someone in the industry, caustic
    soda is used in pulp mills to help break down the wood fiber into paper pulp.
    To the best of my knowledge, however, this mill did not have an on-site pulp
    mill, although it did have a recycling facility, so I am not exactly sure
    precisely what the caustic soda was used for.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="/photo/pwr/1024/IMG_2934.jpg"><img src="photo/pwr/IMG_2934.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>There are two vats in the chemical room which look like they may have been
    used to store or perhaps mix chemicals. This one is labelled, &quot;Lime
    Soda Ash.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="/photo/pwr/1024/IMG_2935.jpg"><img src="photo/pwr/IMG_2935.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>This is the other vat; it is labelled &quot;Sodium Phosphate.&quot; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="/photo/pwr/1024/IMG_2938.jpg"><img src="photo/pwr/IMG_2938.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>The hatch on the top of this chemical tank was easy to open, so here is
    a view of the tank's contents.</p>

  <p>Backtracking to the main room, we find this office which is in ruins thanks
    to vandals.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A close-up of a chart recorder paper that has been unthinkingly cast upon
    the floor.</p>

  <p>Here's the breakroom or washroom. It's pretty much a mess.</p>
  <p><a name="sink"></a></p>
  <p><a href="/photo/pwr/1024/IMG_2951.jpg"><img src="photo/pwr/IMG_2951.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>And it contains a very strange sink. I have been informed that on this type
    of sink, the water comes out of the faucet head up at the top, in all directions,
    so that it can be used by many people at the same time. I bet this comes
    in handy at break/quitting times. C. Demaine adds that the object thrown
    into the sink is an electrical disconnect, and that &quot;Boy, you don't
    just see that every day. Thankfully.,&quot; to which I concur :).</p>

  <p>As we head back into the main room, we get ready to proceed up the stairs
    to the turbine room.</p>
