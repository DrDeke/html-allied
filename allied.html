There are also   several electrical switchgear cabinets on the property, a Consumers' Energy   substation (which has now mostly been removed by Consumers'), and the remains   of an overhead viaduct that once carried steam, process water, and perhaps electricity   between the above mentioned buildings on the north side of Alcott street and   the former Mill A and Mill B buildings south of Alcott. (Mills A and B were   torn down some years ago.)</p><p align="left">The Allied Paper Mill had already been completely abandoned when I first became aware of its existence, but Mill C still   had electrical service to its lighting and remaining machinery, and some of   the control panels in the Power House were still lit, although the building's   overall electrical service did not appear to be online. However, several weeks after   a court hearing about the property in the summer of 2001,  Consumers' Energy deactivated and then removed most of the components   of the substation that had been powering the facility, leaving it completely dark. </p><p align="left">In December of 2000, the remaining portion of Mill E, the vast majority of which had been torn     down in the past, collapsed under the weight of the snow that had accumulated on its roof. </p><p align="left">On October 18th,     2001, one of the front sections of Mill C consisting mostly of laboratory and     office space caught fire, evidently as a result of actions by vandals or other     criminals. The fire department quickly extinguished this fire,     and the damage was confined to the office/lab portion of Mill C largely due to the firewall between     it and the other areas of the mill. </p><p align="left">On July 18th, 2003, around 5:00PM, the section of Mill D containing the <a href="milld-3.html">Latex and Clay Tanks</a> burned down. According to the Kalamazoo Gazette, the neighbors suspect arson, and I would concur with this since there is no electrical or natural-gas service to Mill D. <a href="milld-fire.html">Click here</a> for more information and photographs of the wreckage.</p><p align="left">In 2004, the City of Kalamazoo hired the Homrich company to tear down the rest of the Allied mill once and for all. As of mid-July 2004, workers have begun removing asbestos from the mill buildings, but work has not yet commenced on the actual demolition of the mill.</p><p align="left"><strong>Additional Links:</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.winkworth.us/alliedpaper/">Jeremy Winkworth's Allied Paper Site</a> (Includes Allied photos from 1980!)<br>    <a href="powerhouselog.html">Read Entries from the Powerhouse Operations Logbook from 1987</a><a href="/"><br>    </a><a href="/forum/">AlliedPaper.org Discussion Boards</a><br>    <a href="/">Other Factories at AlliedPaper.org</a><br>    <a href="mailto:allied@alliedpaper.org">E-Mail the Author</a> (allied@alliedpaper.org)</p><p><strong>We'd love to hear from you:</strong> If you visit this site and like it, don't like it, if you're from Kalamazoo or work in the paper industry, if you're familiar with Allied Paper, used to work there or know someone who did, or would just like to say hi, please visit the <a href="http://www.alliedpaper.org/forum/">discussion board</a> (no account needed), or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:allied@alliedpaper.org">allied@alliedpaper.org</a>.
