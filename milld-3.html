  <p>After emerging from the spiral staircase, we find ourselves in a large warehouse/storage 
    room in the front of Mill D. 
    One can see the Powerhouse out the windows.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2630.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2630.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>On the other side of the room from the Powerhouse, there is a passage over 
    the river leading to another small building that is part of the Mill D complex.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Entering the passage.</p>

  <p>The views out the windows are very beautiful (at least, they are as far as 
    I'm concerned).<br>
    [The left photo is taken out the passage window; the right was taken out of 
    an office window on the far side of the passage]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2634.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2634.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>The first thing on the other side of the passage is an office, which has 
    been torn up considerably.</p>
  <p><a name="indroom"></a></p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2646.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2646.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Moving past the office, we find an industrial room containing lots of strange 
    things... A visitor to this site who works in the paper industry pointed out 
    that the items in those boxes are core plugs - these are inserted into the 
    hollow core at the center of a paper roll in order to prevent the core from 
    being crushed during shipment and handling. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2637.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2637.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a> 
  </p>
  <p>...such as these holes in the floor, where once machines or tanks presumably 
    stood.</p>

  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2639.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2639.jpg" width="640" height="480" border="2"></a> 
  </p>
  <p>The labels on this tank level monitor indicate that the tanks contained latex 
    and clay... Don't you wonder what those were used for in a paper mill? Well, 
    I did, until I was told that latex acts as a surfactant and clay as a brightener, 
    and an agent to add opaqueness to paper. I have also been told that latex 
    is a primary ingredient in paper/cardboard milk cartons, and that clay can 
    be used in concentrations up to 17% as a filler (since clay is generally cheaper 
    than wood fiber).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2640.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2640.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>More equipment on the same panel.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2641.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2641.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>This part of the panel contains lots of indicators and knobs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2642.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2642.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>These small cardboard rolls seem too small to be rolls for storing paper 
    on, but that sure is what they appear to be.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2643.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2643.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>The room contains a couple of smallish tanks...</p>
  <p><a name="pulpchests"></a></p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2644.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2644.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>...and some larger tanks, or, chests. Perhaps these were the Latex Tank, 
    Clay Tank, and No.1 and No.2 storage tanks. (Storage of what?)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2647.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2647.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>That chest/tank in the background goes all the way to the ceiling and all 
    the way through the floor to the ground level below (the floor below this 
    has been explored but not photographed). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2483.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2483.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>Departing from our actual tour for a moment; we bring you an image of a door 
    leading to the area directly below where we are now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2649.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2649.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>There's a receipt for some cores; perhaps the ones seen earlier. Evidently, 
    in its last incarntion, this factory did business as Portage Paper. From records 
    found in the Powerhouse, we believe that it ceased operation in 1998 or 1999; 
    evidently Mill D was still running at least through 1996.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="photo/milld/1024/IMG_2650.jpg"><img src="photo/milld/IMG_2650.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="2"></a></p>
  <p>On our way back; man that office is a mess!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>On the way back, we pause to look out more windows. The picture on the left 
    was taken out of a window before crossing the walkway, and the one on the 
    right was taken out the walkway window.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that we're back in the Mill D Warehouse/Shipping room, lets <a href="milld-4.html">head 
    to the paper machine room of Mill D.</a></p>
